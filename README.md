# Dovlatov Highlights

Bring discipline to your writing — the way Sergei Dovlatov did.

Sergei Dovlatov, a Russian writer, avoided using words that start with the same letter within a single sentence. This
constraint helped him keep prose sharp and free of empty repetition. This JetBrains IDE plugin brings that principle
into your editor by highlighting such repetitions so you can tighten your sentences quickly.

## What it does

- Analyzes plain text files in real time
- Splits text into phrases by `.`, `!`, `?`, `;` and `"`
- Considers only words longer than three letters
- Highlights words that start with the same letter in the same phrase
- Scales color intensity by how dominant that starting letter is in the phrase (more dominance → brighter color)

## Why

The Dovlatov principle exposes repetition and tightens sentences. You will see patterns that bloat rhythm and clarity,
and revise faster.

## Ideal for

Writers, editors, and translators who want to avoid monotony and enforce stylistic discipline.

### Usage

- Open a plain text file
- The plugin annotates phrases automatically
- Toggle per-file on/off via the editor context menu:
    - Right‑click in editor → "Toggle Dovlatov Annotator"
